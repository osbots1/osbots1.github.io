#### How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?  
  
# ★ ★ ★ ★ ½
  
My example ratings here are for our third year project group, BIT Platform… We have scheduled meetings every Monday and Thursday, and I am always in attendance. To the best of my knowledge, I have not missed a single meeting this year. Here is a picture from one of our group meetings:

#### How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?

Most of my communication happens on Slack. I try to respond to questions and comments in a timely fashion, and routinely solicit information from the other group members. Here are some examples of my communication with BIT Platform members:

#### How well did you document your work throughout the project?

Yeah, about that . . .  
I feel that my documentation via Slack and in my coding was fine, but I was a bit remiss when it came to recording my work as I went. Their were two main reasons why I failed to document my work effectively:  
    1.  I am inherintly lazy  
    2.   
Not super well… I did a lot of the writing on the boards when we would brainstorm as a group, but I rarely documented our discussions afterwards. I could claim that this was intentional, a sort of “teaching moment” to allow students to take ownership of the documentation process, but really I was being lazy…
I think when I do get around to documenting things, I go above and beyond (for example, this portfolio!), but I am a little slow in starting the process, and I rarely keep it up consistently…
Below is an example image of the overall BIT Platform project structure that I brainstormed with the group and then took a photo of on my phone:

#### How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?

I feel I coped well with changing requirements, of which there were many! The client's forms were quite varied in their structure, resulting in many alterations to the initial database design. After the database design was completed, the client surprised us with a new form for a Small Unmanned Vehicle. This form's fields were quite different from the others. I suggested that we ask the client if he would like us to "normalise" his form. This made the process for the team simpler, while still achieving a great result for the customer.
