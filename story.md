#### In the beginning . . .  
  
Where to begin? Clearly not at the very beginning, that's a very poor place to start. Perhaps that is why I missed the first class and quickly felt lost in Software Engineering. What was all this talk of scrums, sprints, and being agile; is this a sports science class? As a part timer, I do not know a lot of my class mates, nor they me. The unknown is always a concern, this is especially true for group assignments. I was fortunate enough that in my first Software Engineering class there was someone I knew. Better yet, I knew them to be intelligent and hard working. After a brief chat with the bi-streamial Albert, I was invited to join his team in the alternate stream. I crossed streams and was soon introduced to the team and Project 1. The feeling of being out of my depth had not yet abated, but I soon got to know the team that had adopted me.

My team. What a team! I feel very lucky to have joined such a diverse and well-rounded team. Initially I felt like an outsider, as I had joined the team after the initial forming, storming, norming, performing process. I tried hard not to make it "stormy" again, as this was clearly a fast-paced class and there simply was not time. I sat back and watched and learned. I learned a little bit about making a wheel spin in JavaScript, but I learned a whole lot more about my new team. They were resourceful, flexible, and organised. For example, the initial direction of the project was to use C#; however, Scott found an example of what we were trying to achieve in HTML. The team quickly changed tack and our project became web based. This worked better with my skill set and I found myself becoming a much more useful member of the team. Project 1 seemed to race by, with most of the work being undertaken in class. Two of our team members work full time, while the others have part time work, or full time Polytech commitments (or both). To get around this issue, we utilised Slack for communicating outside of class time. This enabled us to share documents, discuss ideas and keep abreast of what tasks each team member was undertaking.

Along with discussing tasks on Slack, we recorded tasks on our Trello board.  
>Trello is a web-based project management application originally made by Fog Creek Software in 2011, that was spun out to form the basis of a separate company in 2014 and later sold to Atlassian in January 2017. The company is based in New York City.  
  
Thanks Wikipedia!  
Trello allowed us to record and assign tasks on a web based platform that updates in real-time. It was another invaluable tool for team members that often worked in isolation. My favourite aspect of Trello is that it gives a clear visual representation of the projects tasks. I am predominantly a visual learner; you can talk to me until you're blue in the face, or just draw me a diagram and I will get it in seconds. I have since forced Trello upon my colleagues at work and it has quickly become a very useful tool for managing our many projects.  
  
As I have started discussing the benefits of the Software Engineering paper, lets continue. Personally, I have mixed feelings about the way in which the class works. On one hand, I feel that Polytech is not cheap and here we are doing a lot of self-guided learning. On the other hand, I appreciate that self-guided learning is a skill in itself; potentially one that some of the students may be lacking. I expect this would be particularly true of some of the younger students. The introduction to techniques and technology has been very useful. As stated earlier, I have adopted some of the tools introduced at Polytech for use in my every day work. Overall, Software Engineering has been an enjoyable learning experience. This is largely due to the groups that I have been involved with. Especially the group for the main project . . .  
  
#### Main Project   
  
The topics for the main project were introduced and I immediately leaned towards one that seemed to have a clearly defined scope. That project was for Aviation Claims Ltd and involved creating web-based versions of the forms for the client (Derek). I was sold on the project, as I have experience with HTTP, PHP and MySQL, which I anticipated as being some of the major building blocks of the project. Our old team from Project 1 had worked very well together, so we discussed our options and (almost unanimously) decided that we would focus our CVs and target the same project.  
We were getting the band back together!

The team had some new editions who quickly found their places and the team was back in production mode. We had scrums to work out what needed to be done, tasks were assigned, Trello boards created. We even created a timeline for the project, which indicated a spare month . . . oh how naive we were! The old ninety-ninety rule of coding floated into my mind:  
> The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.  
— Tom Cargill, Bell Labs  
  
This rule certainly seemed to hold true for our project. The database creation, which was assigned to me and Phil, was a much more time-consuming process then I first anticipated. I was already expecting it to be a challenge, but the nature of the various forms, their disparity to each other, and the fact that additional forms were added late in the piece, meant that the database seemed to be in a constant state of flux. This in turn meant that the web versions of the forms had to be re-adjusted frequently to fit the new database structure. In hindsight, we should have had more team members reviewing the paper forms initially and pressed our client to make sure he had not omitted any. I guess it comes down to the six P's of project management: proper planning prevents piss poor performance. While Phil and I were working on the database, the rest of the team were working on the online version of the forms. The forms were coming together rapidly, and Phil and I certainly felt the pressure of holding up the team.

As the project progressed, it seemed that our scrums became less formal. I think part of it was that we were in constant communication, so it felt less important; however, another part of it was that everyone seemed reluctant to step up and assert their dominance over the team. For my part, I was enjoying not being in charge of anything at Polytech. It was a welcome reprieve from my normal work day. Looking back, I should have been more assertive at times, even if only to declare someone else as the scrum master. Regardless, the time table slipped, and we were all feeling the pressure to get our tasks done.

Once the database was up and running, Phil and I needed other tasks. Phil dove into researching the required file-upload functionality, while I debated with Albert the way in which we would use PHP to interface with our forms and the database. I found these debates to be extremely beneficial. They were not arguments, just a constructive conversation about potential pathways to a solution. Albert had been using a "controller" approach in one of his papers, so we decided to build on that and I set about creating the first "model" to interface between the controller and the database. I found it fascinating that our organic approach to handling the project lead us to the well-known model-view-controller software architectural pattern. I guess there is a good reason why that exists, and it finally makes sense to me now!

#### So, what did I get out of it?

In the later stages of the project I could be found bouncing from one desk to another; helping troubleshoot issues, pair programming, or just guiding someone to discover a solution; that's the kind of stuff that really gets me going. I believe pair programming should be pushed more at Polytech. There is usually a proficiency imbalance when you are pair programming. This means there is someone in a guiding role and someone in a learning role; however, something that I have come to understand is that when teaching, we do our best learning.  
The paper also forced me to think about me:  
    - how I view others  
    - how I am viewed by others  
    - my strengths  
    - my other strengths (like modesty)  
and of course, my weaknesses . . .  
*I am inherently lazy, I sometimes find it hard to get motivated to do a task unless there is some real pressure. I have now started listing my work tasks on my own Trello board with set deadlines . . . so far, it's working!  
** Well, it's working reasonably well. It would be working better if I didn't have too much work to do anyway.  
Plus I had fun mucking around with Jekyll!  
In short, very informative for a self-guided learning paper ;)
