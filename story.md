#### In the beginning . . .  
  
Where to begin? Clearly not at the very beginning, that's a very poor place to start. Perhaps that is why I missed the first class and quickly felt lost in Software Engineering. What was all this talk of scrums, sprints, and being agile; is this a sports science class? As a part timer, I do not know a lot of my class mates, nor they me. The unknown is always a concern, this is especially true for group assignments. I was fortunate enough that in my first Software Engineering class there was someone I knew. Better yet, I knew them to be intelligent and hard working. After a brief chat with the bi-streamial Albert, I was invited to join his team in the alternate stream. I crossed streams and was soon introduced to the team and Project 1. The feeling of being out of my depth had not yet abated, but I soon got to know the team that had adopted me.

My team. What a team! I feel very lucky to have joined such a diverse and well rounded team. Initially I felt like an outsider, as I had joined the team after the initial forming, storming, norming, performing process. I tried hard not to make it "stormy" again, as this was clearly a fast paced class and there simply was not time. I sat back and watched and learned. I learned a little bit about making a wheel spin in javascript, but I learned a whole lot more about my new team. They were resourceful, flexible, and organised. For example, the initial direction of the project was to use C#; however, Scott found an example of what we were trying to achieve in HTML. The team quicly changed tack and our project became web based. This worked better with my skill set and I found myself becoming a much more useful member of the team. Project 1 seemed to race by, with most of the work being undertaken in class. Two of our team members work full time, while the others have part time work, or full time Polytech commitments (or both). To get around this issue, we utilised Slack for communicating outside of class time. This enabled us to share documents, discuss ideas and keep abrest of what tasks each team member was undertaking.

Along with discussing tasks on Slack, we recorded tasks on our Trello board.  
>Trello is a web-based project management application originally made by Fog Creek Software in 2011, that was spun out to form the basis of a separate company in 2014 and later sold to Atlassian in January 2017. The company is based in New York City.  
  
Thanks Wikipedia!  
Trello allowed us to record and assign tasks on a web based platform that updates in real-time. It was another invaluable tool for team members that often worked in isolation. My favourite aspect of Trello is that it gives a clear visual representation of the projects tasks. I am prodominantly a visual learner; you can talk to me until you're blue in the face, or just draw me a diagram and I will get it in seconds. I have since forced Trello upon my collegues at work and it has quickly become a very useful tool for managing our many projects.  
  
As I have started discussing the benefits of the Software Engineering paper, lets continue. Personally, I have mixed feelings about the way in which the class works. On one hand, I feel that Polytech is not cheap and here we are doing a lot of self-guided learning. On the other hand, I appreciate that self-guided learning is a skill in itself; potentially one that some of the students may be lacking. I expect this would be particularly true of some of the younger students. The introduction to techniques and technology has been very useful. As stated earlier, I have adopted some of the tools introduced at Polytech for use in my every day work. On the whole, Software Engineering has been an enjoyable learning experience. This is largely due to the groups that I have been involved with. Especially the group for the main project . . .  
  
#### Main Project   
  
The topics for the main project were introduced and I immediately leaned towards one that seemed to have a clearly defined scope. That project was for Aviation Claims Ltd and involved creating web-based versions of the forms for the client (Derek). I was sold on the project, as I have experience with HTTP, PHP and MySQL, which I anticipated as being some of the major building blocks of the project. Our old team from Project 1 had worked very well together, so we discussed our options and (almost uninanimously) decided that we would focus our CVs and target the same project. We were getting the band back together!
